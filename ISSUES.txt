RESET ISSUE on IMX8DXL:
 - Rarely the board (only iMX8DXL) goes in an unstable state and we can't communicate with an IP of the board (GPIO expander PCA6416).
 This IP controls reset GPIOs and Switch Resistance GPIOs thus they could become unreachable.
 Features requiring GPIO control become unusable (e.g switching between High/Low current shunt, board reset).
